Hello professor,

I also provided a makefile to make this program (just type ./main and the program will start, 
or you can use the command line:
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp CPU.h CPU.cpp printer.h printer.cpp disk.h disk.cpp PCB.h -o main

The main.cpp file is the main file. The codes are in cpp. 

Thank you,
Jong Han Lee
